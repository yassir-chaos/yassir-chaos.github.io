face is choosing between FPGAs and microcontrollers. This choice significantly
impacts development time, cost, performance, and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building Effective CI/CD Pipelines for Embedded Systems</title><link>https://example.com/articles/cicd-embedded-systems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/articles/cicd-embedded-systems/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices have
revolutionized software development, but applying these principles to embedded
systems presents unique challenges. This article explores strategies for
building robust CI/CD pipelines specifically tailored for embedded development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>From Concept to Prototype: Accelerating Hardware Development</title><link>https://example.com/articles/prototyping-acceleration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/articles/prototyping-acceleration/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The journey from initial concept to working prototype is often the most
critical phase in hardware development. Speed, cost, and quality must be
carefully balanced to validate designs efficiently while minimizing risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
